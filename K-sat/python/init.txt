randomly generate k-SAT problems.  The program must accept values for k, m the number of clauses in the formula, and n the number of variables.  Each clause of length k must contain distinct variables or their negation.  Instances generated by this algorithm belong to fixed clause length models of SAT and are known as uniform random k-SAT problems.
