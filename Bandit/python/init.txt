Consider a binary bandit with two rewards {1-success, 0-failure}.  The bandit returns 1 or 0 for the action that you select, i.e. 1 or 2.  The rewards are stochastic (but stationary).  Use an epsilon-greedy algorithm discussed in class and decide upon the action to take for maximizing the expected reward.
